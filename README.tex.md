# generalized_spinfoam

We provide functions which can be used to generate the boundary data as well as corresponding critical configurations of generalized spin foam model (Conrady-Hnybida extension, ArXiv:1002.1959).

Here we use it to demonstrate the parity transformation to generate new gauge inequivalent solutions of the extended spinfoam models. 
Such transformation is given as
$$
g \to g^{-1 \dagger}, for su2
g \to g^{-1 \dagger} i \sigma_3, for su11
$$
The analytic derivation is shown in the note.
