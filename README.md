# generalized_spinfoam

We provide functions which can be used to generate the boundary data as well as corresponding critical configurations of generalized spin foam model (Conrady-Hnybida extension, ArXiv:1002.1959).

Here we use it to demonstrate the parity transformation to generate new gauge inequivalent solutions of the extended spinfoam models. 
Such transformation is given as

The analytic derivation is shown in the note.
